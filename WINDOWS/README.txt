This directory contains a port of netmap to Windows.

For installation instructions see below

When using netmap with Windows NICs, the name to use for the interface is

	netmap:ethXX

where XX is the 'interface index' that you can show with the command

	netsh int ipv4 show interfaces

(or many other ways)

------------ BRIEF DESCRIPTION ----------

The solution Netmap.sln contains the following projects:

netmap
    the core of the netmap kernel module, can be used by itself to
    create VALE ports and netmap pipes

netmap-pkg
    a Test signed version of netmap module to be used on a 64 bit version
    of Windows with Test Sign mode activated

nm-ndis
    a kernel module to attach the netmap core to a
    physical network devices through NDIS hooks

nm-ndis-pkg
    a Test signed version of the above, again for use on 64 bit versions
    of Windows with Test Sign mode activated

loader
    a userspace program to dynamically load and unload the Netmap kernel
    module without the need to install it and load it at OS startup.

sysctl
    (not complete) a tool to manipulate the sysctl variables in the netmap module.

Projects are visual studio files, .vcxprj . The format is defined in

http://blog.bfitz.us/?p=922

The directory ../examples contains pkt-gen, a userspace program
used to test the speed of a link between two netmap interfaces.


------------ INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS (netmap core)------------
The netmap core module implements the basic netmap API, the VALE
software switch and pipes.
It can be loaded dynamically, or installed as a service and loaded at boot time.

a) DYNAMIC LOAD: 
    - Open a "cmd" window with administrative privileges
    - Change into the directory containing netmap.sys< typically
		WINDOWS/Output-Win8.1Release/netmap-pkg

    - To load the module, run
		../nm-loader l
      a message on the console window will report the success or failure of the operation

    - To unload the module run
		../nm-loader u

b) PERSISTENT INSTALL MODULE
    - Open the folder containing netmap.{sys|inf|cat} , same as above
    - Right click on the .inf file and select -INSTALL- from the
      context menu; after a reboot the module will be correctly loaded

------------ INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS (nm-ndis module)------------
The nm-ndis module implement communication with NDIS adapters and the host stack.
It implements a lightweight filter that runs as a service on an adapter

netcfg
    - open the configuration panel for the network card in use
       " Control panel -> network and sharing center -> Change adapter settings "
    - right click on an adapter then click on " Properties "
    - click on " Install -> Service -> Add "
    - click on 'Driver Disk' and select the folder
		WINDOWS/Output-Win8.1Release/nm-ndis-pkg
    - select the service "Netmap NDIS LightWeight Filter"
    - click accept on the warnings for the installation of an unsigned
      or test-signed driver

If the netmap core module has been installed in a dynamic way,
remember to deinstall the nm-ndis module before a shutdown/reboot
and before unloading the netmap core module.

------------ NETMAP BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ----------
Requirements:
To build the module you need to install (in this order):
  - Visual Studio 2013 (express is enough)
	https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs
      Note, you can reach the 2013 version from the
	'Download older versions' link

  - Windows Driver Kit (WDK) version 8.1 update
	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg454513.aspx

 - Cygwin,
	http://www.cygwin.com/
   with base packages, make, c compiler, eventually gdb
   used to build the userspace program pkt-gen


a) Build with the Visual studio GUI
    - Open the <root directory>\WINDOWS\VsSolution\Netmap.sln solution
    - Select on the build type combobox the type of Operating System (Win7/8/8.1)
      and the type of build (Debug/Release)
    - Click on "Compile", then "Compile solution"
    - The output will be found under
	<root directory>\WINDOWS\Output-<chosen-build-type>\

b) Build with command line tools and MsBuild.exe
   We have a makefile which builds everything, just run
	make		# will build all projects and pkt-gen
	make clean	# will clean output directories

   The output will be found in the directory ./Output-<choosen build type>

   Please look at the makefile to select different configurations



------------ GENERAL TIPS -----------------------------------
Performance testing requires a bit of attention to make sure
that processes do not move between different cores, that the
CPU clock speed does not change, and that the switch does not
drop packets because of unrecognised MAC addresses.

--- Configuration of the software switch (Hyper-V) ---
- Always specify the MAC address of the sender
- By default, Hyper-V drops packets with MAC addresses not associated
  to the given port. To allow any traffic,
	Go into the configuration of the VM
	under "setting->NIC->Advanced Features"
	enable "Mac Spoofing"

--- Pinning cores (Hyper-V) ---
	Go into the configuration of the VM
	under settings->Processor
		Virtual machine reserve (percentage)	100
		(not clear if there is a way to pin the thread)

--- PERFORMANCE ---

The typical experiment involve one netmap sender and one netmap receiver

	pkt-gen-b -i <interface-name> -f tx ...
	pkt-gen-b -i <interface-name> -f rx ...

this version of pkt-gen uses busy-wait. The interface name can be a VALE port
or a NIC or host port using the nm-ndis module (emulating the netmap API,
so not as fast as the drivers using native netmap mode available on FreeBSD
and Linux).

VALE port:	30Mpps with broadcast frames

	pkt-gen-b -i vale0:a -f tx
	pkt-gen-b -i vale0:b -f rx

NETMAP pipe	up to 180 Mpps

	pkt-gen-b -i vale0:a}1 -f tx
	pkt-gen-b -i vale0:a{1 -f rx

NETMAP to HOST ring	about 2.3 Mpps if dropped, 1.8Mpps to windump
	pkt-gen-b -i netmap:1^ -f tx	# on one vm

NETMAP to NIC ring	about 1Mpps VM-to-VM
	pkt-gen-b -i netmap:1 -f tx	# on one vm
	pkt-gen-b -i netmap:1 -f rx	# on another vm
